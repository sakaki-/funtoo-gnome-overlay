funtoo-gnome-overlay
====================

GNOME overlay for Funtoo Linux

This forked repo is for use by Gentoo users who have the `funtoo-2-gentoo` shim overlay installed. It is intended to isolate them from any large-scale reorganizations in the upstream repository.

Particularly problematic ebuilds from the Funtoo upstream may also be dropped or modified in this fork.

For more details, please see the [funtoo-2-gentoo](https://github.com/sakaki-/funtoo-2-gentoo) project.
